# SCS2202_Project_CS35
2nd year group project of SCS2202 group number CS35. A web based application system named "Sportude" that is a online reservation system for sports complexes.

Constants of the application must be defined in both server side and the client side.
Client side constants are stored in the file called "CONSTANTS.js" in the JS folder.
Server side constatns are stored in the file called "CONSTANTS.php" in the controller folder.

Note that these constants are for the behavior of the application requirements (ex: Reservation time period)

Server Configurations are defined in the config.php file and it is stored in the root folder. But it is not in the repository yet. It will be added as template when all is finished.
